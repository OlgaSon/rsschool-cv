## About me
My name is Olga, I am 31 years old and last two years I am a Business Analyst in private trading companies.  Before this I have worked as a procurement specialist and a head of procurement and logistic department. 
I decided to change the area because I really like not only to give advises and manage but also truly help my friends and colleagues to find the best solution to their problems. Especially, the moment of a big pleasure for me is when there is a working situation in which no one knows what to do but after some time of search and thoughts it becomes clearer and decision shows up.
Beside work,  my life is full of sport such as a bicycle and fitness. One year ago it was also full of travelling. As it s not so easy to do it now, i currently explore Belarus and neigborhood of Minsk.
